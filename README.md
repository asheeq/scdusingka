Skin cancer is one of the most common types of human malignancy in medical sec-tor.  Normally, it is being diagnosed visually starting with an initial clinical screeningand then possibly followed by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathologicalexamination.  Application of machine learning is continuously being used to deter-mine the accuracy of detecting different medical problems more effectively.  A lotof new techniques have been discovered to fast forward the procedure with havinghighest percentage of accuracy.  In this thesis work, we have proposed a model todetect skin cancer more effectively using image processing with convolutional neu-ral network, a part of deep learning concept under machine learning.  The datasetcontains  almost  3000+  images  of  the  patients  having  skin  diseases  classified  intotwo classes, malignant and benign.  We have introduced CNN along with its sevendifferent  architectures  to  find  the  accuracy  of  the  images  of  skin  cancer  and  per-formed a comparative analysis to find out the best architecture that suits this typeof problem.  Among all the architectures Xception performed the best results withhaving almost 85.303% accuracy to determine skin cancer. Furthermore a new model was introduced which suppress the accuracy of predefined models.
